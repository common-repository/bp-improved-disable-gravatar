Simple and lightweight plugin to disable Gravatar fallback when profile picture is missing on BuddyPress, for better privacy without third-party requests.

== Description ==

Simplest plugin to disable Gravatar on BuddyPress, for people who just want to run the code "add_filter('bp_core_fetch_avatar_no_grav', '__return_true');" as a plugin that can be easily enabled or disabled.

The plugin was created to improve privacy when using my Premium "BuddyPress Improved" plugins (search members by distance and WebRTC webcam video chat). It can be used with any other plugins without conflicts.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin via the WordPress repository or by uploading the ZIP file.

2. Enable the plugin through the WordPress menu.
